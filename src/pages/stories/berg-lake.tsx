      <p>
        The Berg Lake Trail is often called one of Canada's best backpacking trips, 
        and after completing it, I understand why. This 23-kilometer trail through 
        Mount Robson Provincial Park leads you past waterfalls, ancient forests, 
        and glaciers, culminating at the stunning turquoise waters of Berg Lake.
      </p>

      <p>
        Standing at the trailhead, looking up at Mount Robson - the highest peak in 
        the Canadian Rockies at 3,954 meters - I felt both excited and slightly 
        intimidated. The forecast called for clear skies, a rarity in this notoriously 
        wet corner of BC.
      </p>

      <h2>Day One: To Whitehorn Campground</h2>

      <p>
        The first day covers about 10 kilometers to Whitehorn Campground. The trail 
        starts gently through the Valley of a Thousand Falls, living up to its name 
        with countless cascades tumbling down from the mountains above.
      </p>

      <p>
        The highlight of day one is Emperor Falls - a thundering 40-meter cascade that 
        you can walk right up to. The mist from the falls provided a refreshing break 
        after the long climb.
      </p>

      <p>
        Whitehorn Campground sits in a beautiful meadow with views of Mount Robson's 
        north face. We set up camp, filtered water from the nearby creek, and watched 
        the alpenglow paint the peaks pink and orange as the sun set.
      </p>

      <h2>Day Two: Berg Lake</h2>

      <p>
        The final push to Berg Lake is only about 6 kilometers, but it's all uphill. 
        As we climbed, the forest gave way to alpine meadows, and suddenly, there it was - 
        Berg Lake in all its glory.
      </p>

      <p>
        The lake gets its name from the massive blue-white icebergs that regularly calve 
        off the Berg Glacier and float across the milky turquoise water. The color comes 
        from glacial flour - fine rock particles suspended in the meltwater.
      </p>

      <h2>Exploring the Area</h2>

      <p>
        We spent two nights at Berg Lake, using the extra day to explore:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Hiked to Hargreaves Glacier - a steep but rewarding scramble</li>
        <li>Watched icebergs slowly drift and occasionally flip over with a crack like thunder</li>
        <li>Photographed the glacier at dawn when the light is magical</li>
        <li>Spotted mountain goats on the cliffs above camp</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>The Wildlife</h2>

      <p>
        Mount Robson is home to abundant wildlife. Over our four days, we saw:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>A black bear grazing in the meadows (we gave it plenty of space)</li>
        <li>Mountain goats traversing impossibly steep cliffs</li>
        <li>Pikas squeaking warnings from rockpiles</li>
        <li>Countless marmots sunbathing on boulders</li>
        <li>A caribou - a rare sighting in BC these days</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Essential Tips</h2>

      <p>
        Planning to hike to Berg Lake? Here's what you need to know:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Book EARLY - permits open January 8th and sell out in hours</li>
        <li>Use the reservation system at Discover Camping BC</li>
        <li>Pack for all weather - it can snow any month of the year</li>
        <li>Bear canisters are mandatory - bring your own or rent at the visitor center</li>
        <li>Best time: Late July to early September for wildflowers and stable weather</li>
        <li>Trail is well-maintained but expect some mud and rocky sections</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>The Return Journey</h2>

      <p>
        Hiking out is easier on the legs but harder on the heart. As Mount Robson 
        disappeared behind us, I was already planning my return trip. This trail has 
        everything - waterfalls, glaciers, turquoise lakes, incredible camping, and 
        the kind of mountain scenery that stays with you long after you've returned home.

      <p>
        If you only do one backpacking trip in the Canadian Rockies, make it Berg Lake.
