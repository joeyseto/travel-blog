        There's something magical about paddling through Algonquin Park in autumn. 
        The vibrant reds, oranges, and yellows reflecting off the still water create 
        a kaleidoscope of color that no photograph can truly capture.
      </p>

      <p>
        Our journey started at the Access Point 1 on Highway 60. The plan was simple: 
        five days, four nights, covering about 50 kilometers through some of Ontario's 
        most beautiful backcountry. What we didn't expect was just how stunning the 
        fall colors would be this year.
      </p>

      <h2>Day One: Into the Wilderness</h2>

      <p>
        The first portage is always the hardest. With a fully loaded canoe, food barrel, 
        and backpacks, the 725-meter carry felt endless. But once we hit the water of 
        Canoe Lake, all the struggle melted away.
      </p>

      <p>
        We paddled through glassy water, the only sounds being our paddles dipping and 
        the occasional call of a loon. By late afternoon, we'd found the perfect campsite 
        on a small island - complete with a rocky outcrop perfect for watching the sunset.
      </p>

      <h2>The Portages</h2>

      <p>
        Over the next few days, we completed eight portages ranging from 150 meters to 
        over a kilometer. Each one was worth it for the pristine lakes that awaited on 
        the other side.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Best portage: The 295m carry to Burnt Island Lake - easy terrain, stunning views</li>
        <li>Toughest portage: The 1,800m slog to Louisa Lake - muddy, uphill, but character-building</li>
        <li>Most scenic: The short 150m carry with panoramic fall foliage views</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Wildlife Encounters</h2>

      <p>
        On day three, we had a moose swim past our campsite at dawn. The massive bull 
        crossed the lake effortlessly, water streaming off its antlers as it emerged 
        on the opposite shore. These are the moments that make you forget about the 
        sore shoulders and bug bites.
      </p>

      <h2>Tips for Fall Paddling in Algonquin</h2>

      <p>
        If you're planning a fall trip to Algonquin, here are some essentials:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Book early - fall is peak season and campsites fill up fast</li>
        <li>Bring warm layers - mornings can be near freezing</li>
        <li>Pack a good waterproof stuff sack - October weather is unpredictable</li>
        <li>Don't forget a bear barrel or rope for hanging food</li>
        <li>Timing matters - aim for late September to mid-October for peak colors</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>The Return</h2>

      <p>
        Our last morning dawned clear and cold. Frost covered our tent fly, and mist 
        rose from the still water. As we loaded the canoe for the final time, I felt 
        that familiar bittersweet feeling - ready to get back to civilization, but 
        already missing the simplicity of life on the water.
      </p>

      <p>
        Algonquin in the fall isn't just a canoe trip - it's a reset button for the soul.
